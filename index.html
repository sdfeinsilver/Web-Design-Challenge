            <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>
            <p>This webpage is the study of one's location on Earth in regards to latitude and the corresponding weather patterns that one might 
                experience.  In short, is there a correlation between latitude and certain weather variables.  To conduct this analysis more than 500 cities
                across the globe were plotted on and analyzed based on 4 different weather variables.
            </p>

            <p>The 4 different weather patterns that were studies were Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed.  In conducting this study,
                we hope to equip future travelers of the globe with relaible information on what type of weather to expect based on their destination
                of choice.  Of course, weather is a random phenomena, but that just makes the anlysis, and the adventure, all the more fun!
