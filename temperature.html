            <p>As you can see, one can expect warmer temperatures as they approach the equator.  One thing that may not be so obvious, however, is that 
                as you move away from the equator, very different things happen depending on whether you are traveling North or South.  If your adventures
                take your south, you can expect moderately cooler temperatures, but nothing too extreme.  If, on the other hand, you venture North,
                expect temperatures to drop drastically.  One thing is for sure, bring your parka!
