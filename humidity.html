            <p>Unfortunately, for all those seeking less humid getaways, humidity appears to be a tough one to track based on location.  That is,
                there does not seem to be much correlation between humidity and latitudinal location.  One not fear though, our educated guess
                is humidity has more to do with proximity to the ocean then it does location in relation to the equator.  May be something our adventurers
                should look into!
