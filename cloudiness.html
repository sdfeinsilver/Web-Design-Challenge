        <p>Of all our scatterplots, cloudiness seems to have the most interesting and unique data set to ponder. One of
            the reasons for this
            is most likely due to the imperfect way of measuring cloudiness. Because the cloudiness metric tends to be
            recorded in increments of
            5 percentage points, there seems to be some linear relationships on the graph. Upon further analysis
            however, there does not seem
            to be much relationship between your likelihood of having fun in the sun and your proximity to Earth's
            equator.
